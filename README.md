# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

- This is my solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ).
- After watching few Vue.js basics tutorials, I wanted to do a project to apply some concepts I learned, before I continue with the tutorials.
- I did not pay (a lot of) attention to responsiveness, which is something that could be improved in the future, as well as a form validation.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## What I learned

The Vue concepts that were applied in this project are:

- Options API
- Creating Vue Components
- Props
- Data bindings
- List rendering
- Conditional rendering
- Dynamic Classes (css)
- Emitting custom events
- Computed Properties
- Very simple form and using v-model for two-way data binding
- The lifecycle hook mounted()
